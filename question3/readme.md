Mary Shelly and Bram Stoker were at a bar one night boasting to one another that their book was better.

“My book is more verbose and must therefore be regarded as of higher quality.”

“Posh! Your loquaciousness simply means that you endlessly prattle on.”

The town drunk, sitting nearby and overhearing their bickering, drunkenly slurs:

“I like vowelsh… whomever used the mosht <hic> has the better book.”

“That seems an egregious measure and would simply favor the larger tome.  Suppose instead we consider which of us wrote the higher percentage of vowels?”

“But my longer book also has more punctuation.  It would be untoward if we allowed such minutia for consideration.”

“Very well then, let us settle this wager! Only letters are under consideration.”

Between Dracula and Frankenstein, which book wins the wager and has the higher percentage of vowels?  



Your answer will be the number of vowels contained in the winning book.



Dracula - https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/345.txt.utf-8

Frankenstein - https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-0.txt
