A triangular number, T(n), is represented as the sum of all values from 1 to n.

Therefore, T(5) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.



In this problem, we are looking at the sum of the digits that comprise the triangular number, and whether that sum results in a number greater than or equal to 10.



So, for example:

T(1) = 1 (sum: 1, NO, not >= 10)

T(2) = 3 (sum: 3, NO)

T(3) = 6 (sum: 6, NO)

T(4) = 10 (sum: 1, NO)

T(5) = 15 (sum: 6, NO)

T(6) = 21 (sum: 3, NO)

T(7) = 28 (sum: 10, YES, >= 10)

28 is the 1st triangular number whose digits sum to a number greater than or equal to 10.



What is the 27th triangular number where the sum of its digits is at least 10?
