Supposing you are dealt cards from the eight decks of cards in the order listed in the attached file.

If the dealer could potentially start dealing from any point among the 8 decks of cards, how many different possible ways could you be dealt consecutive cards which sum to 21?



Notes

Cards are represented as follows:

J = Jack (10 pts.)
Q = Queen (10 pts.)
K = King (10 pts.)
A = Ace (1 or 11 pts.)

A number represents a card of the same numeric value.
You are the only player receiving cards.
You will keep taking cards until your hand reaches or exceeds 21.



Example

For the following smaller deck of cards: J4K7AQ39
There are 3 ways to get 21 from this set:
Starting from card 2: 4K7
Starting with card 4: 7AQ3
Starting with card 5: AQ
