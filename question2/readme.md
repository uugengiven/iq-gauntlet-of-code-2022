Everybody loves the Fibonacci sequence!  Well… apparently not EVERYBODY.  A new sequence has sprung from the devious mind of Dr. Fibonucci.



F(1) = 1

F(2) = 2

F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)

However, if F(n - 1) is even, Dr. Fibonucci says to only use half of F(n - 1).  

Also, to be particularly devious, Dr. Fibonucci says that if F(n - 2) is divisible by 7, an extra 1 must be added to the result.



What is F(50) for Dr. Fibonucci’s sequence?
